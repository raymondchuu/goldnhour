                        <li>Please arrive to your appointment without any eye makeup on, as this will prevent the glue from bonding to your lashes. This will minimize the “clean-up” time, thus having more lashing time.</li>
                        <br/><li>Avoid caffeine so your eyes do not flutter during the process.</li>
                        <br/><li>Do not use any cream, moisturizer or oils around your eye area 24 hours prior.</li>
                        <br/><li>It is recommended to shower before coming to your appointment, since you won’t be able to get your lashes super wet in the following days</li>
                        <br/><li>Removal of contacts lenses is suggested to avoid any irritation of the eyes.</li>

                    <ul className="carebrows-ul">
                    <li>If you like wearing eye makeup, use an oil-free remover + cleanser to clean your lashes. You will have better retention while preventing bacteria build-up that can lead to infection. For best results, use a lash cleanser and a soft eyeshadow brush and go through the lash line via top + bottom (while still have your eye closed). Rinse and repeat if necessary</li>
                    <br/><li>Oily skin types = faster lash loss. When possible, wipe your oily eyelids to prevent oil traveling down to your lashes. </li>
                    <br/><li>If you’re very active, repeat the above when sweating. </li>
                    <br/><li>Brush your lashes daily to help get rid of any fall out and keep them neat </li>
                    <br/><li>Book your refill appointments in advance (2-3 weeks) to maintain the fullness and avoid disappointments. It is recommended to wash your lashes prior to your appointment. </li>
                    <br/><li>Keep in mind that it is normal that natural lashes shed on a daily basis (on avg up to 5 lashes/day)</li>
                    </ul>
                        <br/>
                    <p>Dont's</p>
                    <ul className="carebrows-ul">
                    <li>In the first 24-48hrs after getting your lashes done, avoid fully immersing your eyes in water: hot showers, steam or saunas</li>
                    <br/><li>Avoid wearing eye makeup within this time frame as well </li>
                    <br/><li>Avoid sleeping on your face as you will increase the chances of losing more lashes</li>
                    <br/><li>Avoid using oil-based products around the eye area</li>
                    <br/><li>Avoid picking, rubbing or pulling your lashes as it will result in premature lash loss </li>
                    <br/><li>Do not curl, tint or perm your lashes </li>
                    <br/><li>Do not wear mascara on your lashes as it will loosen the bond. It is always extremely difficult to remove mascara from your extensions. If it is not fully removed, the lash extension will not adhere properly to your natural lashes at your next refill appointment. </li>
                    <br/><li>Avoid coming in contact with extreme heat such as the barbeque, oven, blowdryer, lighters. Extreme heat can burn your lashes and/or loosen the curl of the extension. </li>
                    <br/><li>Don’t remove lashes on your own, seek for a lash professional to quickly remove your lashes pain free! This will ensure the integrity of your natural lashes.</li>
