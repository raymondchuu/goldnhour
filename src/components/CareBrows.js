                <ul className="carebrows-ul">
                    <li>It is crucial to follow proper aftercare to ensure longevity, effectiveness, health and overall satisfaction with your new brow tattoo. Please follow the instructions below to achieve the best possible results.</li>
                    <br/><li>
                        What to expect during the healing period: <br/><br/>
                        Day 1: "I love my brows" <br/><br/>

                        Day 2-5: "Oh no, they're too dark and thick"

                        The first few days, you'll notice that the pigment will appear much darker–THIS IS NORMAL! The reason this happens is (1) larger scabs are forming over the pigment and (2) the color oxidizes (darkens) as it comes into contact with air. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        By DAY 3:  you can use your A + D ointment on your brows and apply a grain size amount. However, use a slightly thicker amount before showering to protect it from getting wet. After you shower, gently dab off excess product to a thinner layer. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Day 5-10: "Ew my brows are scabbing and flaking off!!" 

                        Once the scabs start to flake off, you'll be tempted to pick at the rest. DO NOT pick off your scabs as it may result in scarring and patchy brows. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Day 10+: "Oh my, my brows are too light" 
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <br/><li>Once healed, the brows will look very light or almost next to nothing–This is normal! The color will resurface by the end of the 4-6 week healing period. Thus, allow 6 weeks to see the true results. Any changes can be down at the touch-up appointments.  It is YOUR responsibility to book your complimentary touch-up (4-6 weeks after your initial). If you exceed 6 weeks, you will be charged the next touch-up time frame. The application of permanent cosmetics may be a 2-step procedure. Do not judge your brows while in the healing stage. </li>
                    <br/><li>
                        What to avoid during the healing period: <br/>
                        - Do not touch the treated area with your fingers as any potential bacteria can cause infection<br/>
                        - Do not wet your eyebrows for 7 days <br/>
                        - Avoid makeup on treated area <br/>
                        - If lymph fluids surface, take a clean/dry tissue and pat it dry<br/>
                        - Avoid sleeping on your face/brows for the first 10 days <br/>
                        - Brows will itch, do not scratch as it can cause permanent scarring and loss of pigment <br/>
                        - Avoid making extreme facial expressions as this may cause the scabs to prematurely fall off<br/>
                        - Avoid direct sun exposure and tanning beds for 1 week after your procedure<br/>
                        - Avoid pools, saunas, steam rooms, hot showers and/or hot baths for 1 week<br/>
                        - No exercising for 1 week as sweating through the brows will expel pigment from the dermis producing poor results <br/>
                        - Avoid Retin A, Glycolic acids, aloe, accutane and vitamin E products. Avoid ANY exfoliation products/medications until after your FINAL touch up<br/>
                        - Avoid tinting of brows for 3 weeks following the procedure <br/>
                        - Limit contact with animals near your face  <br/>
                        - Do not donate blood for one year after the procedure <br/>
                    </li>
                    <br/><li>
                        Tips to extend the life of your tattoo: <br/>
                        - Cover your tattoo with vaseline when swimming in sea salt or chlorinated water <br/>
                        - Avoid sun/UV exposure as it will cause the tattoo to fade and change <br/>
                        - Avoid active skincare: skincare products and treatments with active ingredients (ie gycolic, AHAs, retinol, chemical peels) can fade your tattoo or alter the color. If you must apply any products, apply it below your eyes and not on or around the eyebrow<br/>
                        - If you are planning a chemical peel, MRI, or other medical procedure, please inform the technician that you have had an iron-oxide cosmetic tattoo<br/>
                        - If you plan to have laser treatments around the face, tell your specialist to avoid the pigmented area as it may turn the pigment black<br/>
                    </li>
                    <br/><li>Note that all tattoos carry the inherent risk of infection and/or allergic reaction, so if swelling, pain, bruising persists for more than a few days, it may be a sign of infection.  If so, stop using your aftercare product and contact your doctor/brow technician right away. </li>
